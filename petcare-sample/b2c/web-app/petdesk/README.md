# Pet Management Application User Guide

The Pet Management Application is a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) application that allows users to easily register and manage their pets. Users can enter vital information such as their pets' basic information and vaccination records into the app. They can then set up email alerts for their pets' upcoming vaccination dates. 

There are two ways that you can run this sample application

- Method 1: [Using Cloud Deployment](#️-method-1-using-cloud-deployment)
- Method 2: [Run Locally](#️-method-2-run-locally)

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

# ✍️ Method 1: Using Cloud Deployment

This guide will show you how to use [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/), WSO2's SaaS Customer IAM (CIAM) solution to secure user authentication to the web application and add CIAM features to your web application. Also to use [Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/) to expose a service endpoint as a REST API and safely consume the API from a web application.

    | Description | Manage your pets |

5. To allow Choreo to connect to your GitHub account, click **Authorize with GitHub**.
6. If you have not already connected your GitHub repository to Choreo, enter your GitHub credentials, and select the repository you created by forking https://github.com/wso2/samples-is to install the Choreo GitHub App.
7. In the Connect Repository dialog box, enter the following information:

    | Field | Value |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | GitHub Account | Your account |
    | GitHub Repository | samples-is|
    | Branch | master |
    | Build Preset | Click **Ballerina** because you are creating the REST API from a Ballerina project and Choreo needs to run a Ballerina build to build it. |
    | Path | /petcare-sample/b2c/web-app/petdesk/apis/ballerina/pet-management-service |

8. Click **Create** to initialize a Service with the implementation from your GitHub repository.

The Service opens on a separate page where you can see its overview.

Similarly setup the `/petcare-sample/b2c/web-app/petdesk/apis/ballerina/billing-management-service` and `/petcare-sample/b2c/web-app/petdesk/apis/ballerina/salesforce-integration-service` as choreo services. 

When setting up `salesforce-integration-service`, get the following credentials by setting up the salesforce account using this [guide](#setup-salesforce-account-guide). Following configurations will be asked when deploying the service through choreo.

```config
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;
configurable string refreshToken = ?;
configurable string refreshUrl = ?;
configurable string baseUrl = ?;
```

## Step 4.2: Deploy the Service

For the Service to be invokable, you need to deploy it. To deploy the Service, follow the steps given below:
1. Navigate to the **Choreo Console**. 
You will be viewing an overview of the Pet Management Service.
2. Navigate to the **Build** section from left menu and click **Build Latest**.
2. In the left pane, click **Deploy**, and then click **Configure & Deploy**.
3. In the **Configure & Deploy** pane, you will be asking to enter values for the **Defaultable Configurables**.
    - You can setup a **Mysql database** to store the service's data. This is **optional**, and if you do not specify database values, the service will save the data in memory. 

      <details><summary>If you are setting up <b>Mysql Database</b> click here</summary>
      <p>
      
      - Create a Mysql Database using the following database schema.
      
          ```sql
          CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS PET_DB;

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Pet (
              id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
              name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              breed VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              dateOfBirth VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              owner VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
          );

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Vaccination (
              id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
              petId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              lastVaccinationDate VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              nextVaccinationDate VARCHAR(255),
              enableAlerts BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
              FOREIGN KEY (petId) REFERENCES Pet(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
          );

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Thumbnail (
              id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
              fileName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              content MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL,
              petId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              FOREIGN KEY (petId) REFERENCES Pet(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
          );

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Settings (
              owner VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              notifications_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
              notifications_emailAddress VARCHAR(255),
              PRIMARY KEY (owner)
          );
          ```
        
      - Make sure your database is publicly accessible and that your database service allows Choreo IP addresses. Please refer the guide [Connect with Protected Third Party Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/reference/connect-with-protected-third-party-applications/#connect-with-protected-third-party-applications) for more information.

      - Configure the following **Defaultable Configurables** after setting up the database.   

        | Field      |  Value |
        | ---------- | -------- |
        | dbHost     | Database Host. eg: mysql–instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com  |
        | dbUsername | Database username |
        | dbPassword | Database password |
        | dbDatabase | Database name. eg: PET_DB  |
        | dbPort     | Database port. eg: 3306|

      </p>
      </details>

    &nbsp;<br>
    - The Pet Management Service sends email to the users. This is **optional**, and if you specify email configurations here, it will use to send emails to the users. 

      <details><summary>If you are setting up <b>email</b> click here</summary>
      <p>
            
      - In order to send emails to the users, you need to create a client for the SMTP server. Here is a guide for setting up a SMTP client for the **GMail**.
        - You can generate a password for the email username using [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
        - Configure the following **Defaultable Configurables** for the email configuration.   

          | Field      |  Value |
          | ---------- | -------- |
          | emailHost     | SMTP Host. eg: smtp.gmail.com  |
          | emailUsername | Email address |
          | emailPassword | Email password (The app password generated in the above.) |
      
      </p>
      </details>

    &nbsp;<br>
4. Click **Next** on the **Defaultable Configurables** to deploy the service.

                onSuccess: function (context) {
                    var user = context.steps[1].subject;
                    user.claims["http://wso2.org/claims/acr"] = "acr1"
                }

    myAccountAppURL: "<my-account-url>",
    enableOIDCSessionManagement: true
   ```
2. Run the application by executing the following command in the terminal.
    ```
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
3. Visit the sample application at http://localhost:3000. 

## Run API Services
1. Navigate to <PROJECT_HOME>/petcare-sample/b2c/web-app/petdesk/apis/ballerina/pet-management-service and start the 
   pet management service by executing the following command in the terminal.
    ```
    bal run
    ```
2. Navigate to <PROJECT_HOME>/petcare-sample/b2c/web-app/petdesk/apis/ballerina/billing-management-service and start the 
   pet management service by executing the following command in the terminal.

Consumer Secrets

5 .Next step would be to get the token.

- Log in to salesforce in your prefered browser and enter the following url.
```url
https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<CONSUMER_KEY>&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URL>
```
- Allow access if an alert pops up and the browser will be redirected to a Url like follows.

```url
https://login.salesforce.com/?code=<ENCODED_CODE>
```
- The code can be obtained after decoding the encoded code

6. Get Access and Refresh tokens

- Following request can be sent to obtain the tokens.

```curl
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token?code=<CODE>&grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=<CONSUMER_KEY>&client_secret=<CONSUMER_SECRET>&redirect_uri=https://test.salesforce.com/
```
- Tokens can be obtained from the response.

Then start the 
   salesforce integration service by executing the following command in the terminal.
    ```
    bal run
    ```
    
    
> [!NOTE]
> By default, the service stores the data in memory. It can be connected to a MySQL database. Create a `Config.toml` file in the root folder of the service component and add the relevant DB configurations to the `Config.toml` files. Create MySQL database tables using the schemas located in `<PROJECT_HOME>/petcare-sample/b2c/web-app/petdesk/dbscripts directory`.

```
dbHost = "<DB_HOST>" 
dbUsername = "<DB_USERNAME>" 
dbPassword = "<DB_USER_PASSWORD>" 
dbDatabase = "<DB_NAME>" 
dbPort = "<DB_PORT>"
```
